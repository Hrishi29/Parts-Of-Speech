                        <li>The application is a quiz which will contain a set of questions and each question will contain certain words for which you have to identify the parts of speech by dragging and 
                                dropping those words into their respective boxes</li>
                            <li>Each identifyable word is worth 3 points. The maximum points that could be scored for each sentence will be displayed on the screen. </li>
                            <li>You will have 3 attempts to identify the parts of speech for each word and for every incorrect attempt 1 point would be deducted from the maximum score. However after the 
                               third attempt you won't lose a point as the answer would be displayed on the screen via hint. At the end of each sentence you would have correctly identified the parts of 
                               speech for all the words in the sentence.
                            <br><i>Note: For every incorrect attempt a hint will be displayed to correctly identify the parts of speech for the given word</i>.</li>        
                            <li>You cannot go to the next sentence until you have identified all the words for the given sentence. However you can review the previously attempted sentences and check for the 
                                scores for reference.</li>
